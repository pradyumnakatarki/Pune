            <h3>More about the city...</h3>
            <p>Pune is a city which is known for being an old-school,traditionalist city. Those words are definitely used for exactly what they mean and are definitely not a cover to hide the xenophobia so don't even try to further think about it. Punekars take pride in being classist and being better than Mumbai. Even if I'm not the biggest fan of classism(sorry to dissapoint), they are absolutely correct about Pune being the better city.<br><br> The best activity I can think of doing in Mumbai is going to the Platform no. 5 of the CSMT at around 5:30 PM and observing the people. You'll observe that most of them are boarding on a train on the platform. At this point, you should take the smart decision of boarding the train and coming straight back to Pune. Of course I'm exaggerating. There are other interesting things to do in Mumbai as well. For example: you can leave from Dadar, Kalyan, Thane, Dombivali, etc. Fuck that swamp.</p>
